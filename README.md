# ðŸ“¢ RBPI-Sound-Alerts
In the past, I used this project to audibly inform me about the temperature of my Raspberry Pi and its internet connection.

If the device's temperature was too high, a Windows XP system sound would play, and the same would happen in case of a network connection failure.

However, this doesn't work correctly on Windows (probably).
